Hi teacher,

Unfortunately I couldn't finish te assignment the way it was supposed to. Step 1 and 2 went pretty well, but I struggled a lot in step 3 because I couldn't get the current selected model stored in the local state (only the name). 
After trying a lot of things, I managed to do it, only I couldn't get the model details to list in a certain way. I thought you should know that I coudn't do everything exactly as in the assignment, but I at least got it to work eventually.
